I aimed to build a fully functional, linearizable distributed key-value store using the Raft consensus algorithm. To achieve this, I first implemented Raftâ€™s core functionality and then added linearizable reads and a client-side deduplication mechanism to ensure full linearizability. I have both in-memory and disk persistence implementations to allow efficient end-to-end testing. Below are the detailed components of my distributed key-value store.

The store is built in Java using Spring. Persistent states and logs are stored on disk with append-only, file-backed logs, while the state machine is persisted using an embedded H2 database. Internal RPCs and client interactions are handled via RESTful HTTP APIs.
